# Intel® Movidius™ Neural Networks HAL

## Introduction
The Intel® MKL-DNN(Intel® Math Kernel Library for Deep Neural Networks) Neural Network Hardware Abstraction Layer (NN HAL) provides the hardware accelration for Android Neural Networks (NN) API. Intel MKL-DNN Neural Networks HAL takes the advantage of the Intel® MKL-DNN, enables high performance and low power implementation of Neural Networks API. More information about Intel® MKL-DNNis available on [Intel® MKL-DNN](https://github.com/intel/mkl-dnn).

## Integrating Intel® MKL-DNN into Intel® MKL-DNN Neural Networks HAL

To integrate [Intel® MKL-DNN](https://github.com/intel/mkl-dnn) into Intel® MKL-DNN Neural Networks HAL follow the below steps


* Download and extract the [Intel® MKL-DNN](https://github.com/intel/mkl-dnn) -v0.14 as mentioned on the [Intel® MKL-DNN](https://github.com/intel/mkl-dnn)
* Copy the extracted ncsdk to the specified location as shown below
```
cp <DIR>/mkl-dnn <DIR>/Intel_movidius_nn_hal/libmkldnn/mkl-dnn -rf
```
* Make sure the **mkl-dnn** directory is located under **Intel_mkldnn_nn_hal/libmkldnn**


## Validated Models
